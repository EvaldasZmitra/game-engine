# Game Engine

## Introduction

I am writing a game engine from scratch. Using pure C and testing out my new C build system [Ceasium](https://github.com/EvaldasZmitra/ceasium). The aim of this game engine is not be the most cutting edge might performing graphics engine like UE5. The aim of it is to write something that is simple and small, that still allows the user to use simple GLSL shaders.
